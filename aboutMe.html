I have been self-studying and trying to conceptualise the programming language, although I have no experience in applying them in a practically.

              I would like to develop my software development skills and break into the Information Technology industry to develop systems that will not only benefit the corporate world, but also help in solving problems that we face in our immediate communities and the global community as a whole. I would like to see this vision come to frution in the education of the young members of our society by helping them learn in the most beneficial conditions for each child while keeping up with the developments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as this will place them in a position to actively participate in the rapidly changing society and not suffer being victims of misinformation and inability to access the resources for them to keep up with their global peers.
